# WiFi QR Code Generator

This is a simple application built with Angular and Bootstrap that allows you to encode your WiFi access point password into a QR code. Simply enter your WiFi network name and password, and the application will generate a QR code that can be scanned by a mobile device to quickly connect to your WiFi network.

# Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:
## Deployment
To deploy this project run

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OluseunDesina/qrifi.git
  cd qrifi
  npm install
```
This will install all of the required packages and dependencies for the application.

# Running the Application
To run the application, you can use the Angular CLI. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  ng serve
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You should see a form that allows you to enter your WiFi network name and password.

Once you've entered your network name and password, click the "Generate QR Code" button to generate a QR code that you can scan with a mobile device to connect to your WiFi network.

# Building for Production
If you want to build the application for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
  ng build --prod
```

This will create a production-ready version of the application in the dist/qrifi directory.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
